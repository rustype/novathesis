Users face bugs on a daily basis, whether in their instant messaging application or a game,
bugs currently permeate our lives, they are mostly harmless as such applications are not critical,
resulting in some unsent messages or texture glitches.

However, in areas as systems programming, one of the most demanding domains in computer science,
bugs and their respective consequences come at a high cost to both service providers and consumers.
There are reports from several industries where bugs lead to huge monetary losses and even death.

In 2014, the Heartbleed~\autocite{Heartbleed} bug, caused due to a missing bound check,
compromised the security of any OpenSSL user, enabling the theft of critical information (e.g. cryptographic keys).
In 2018, a bug in Coinbase (a popular cryptocurrency exchange)
allowed for account balance manipulation~\autocite{Vicompany2018}.
In 2019 and 2020, after several crashes~\autocite{Campbell2019},
the Boeing 737 Max was grounded to fix existing problems, while grounded,
more software-related issues were
found~\autocite{Okane2019,Okane2020},
delaying its re-certification.
In 2020, as the number of COVID-19 grew,
contact tracing apps were deployed as a mitigation strategy.
The UK's National Health Service app failed to ask users to self-isolate due to a
bug~\autocite{Mageit2020}.

The previous examples are not isolated incidents, the language and nature of the bugs is different for each case,
to put it simply, there is no silver bullet and the next best alternative is to do our best to mitigate them by
building tools and abstractions which allow developers to increase their code's safety.

\section{Problem}\label{sec:problem}

Languages like C/C++ have dominated the systems programming landscape for years and
one of the main problems with both is the lack of memory management.
Leaving such responsibility to the developer has proven to be \emph{a less than ideal}
solution, with $70\%$ of bugs in projects like Chromium~\autocite{chromium}
and Microsoft products~\autocite{Miller2019} being due to memory management.

To address such problem, several tools and languages have been and continue to be developed,
so far, Rust has been the only one to achieve \emph{mainstream} status.
Rust aims to provide memory safety without affecting performance or productivity,
to achieve such ambitious goal, Rust validates code with the borrow checker, which then enforces memory safety rules,
targeting the problem at its root.

Addressing memory safety is not enough though,
languages which side-step the problem of having manual management
through the use of a garbage collector (e.g. Java and Go) still suffer from other kinds bugs.
As discussed in the end of \autoref{sec:context}, we can only mitigate their occurrence, and
so we are required to reach out to new mechanisms.

Typestates are an approach which aims to tame stateful computations,
to do so typestates lift the concept of state to the type level,
this enables the compiler to reason about state and provides the developer
with information of the expected computation state at runtime.

Consider Java's \keyword{Scanner}, its API allows the developer to write code like \autoref{lst:java-scanner},
which will compile without issuing any errors or warnings (even with the \texttt{-Xlint:all} flag).
The example in \autoref{lst:java-scanner} will crash during runtime, since it is not possible to read from a closed source,
the thrown exception is \texttt{IllegalStateException}.
Informing the user that the attempted operation is illegal for the current object state,
ideally we want such illegal states to be detected at compile time.

\begin{listing}
    \begin{minted}{java}
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);         // open the stream
s.nextLine();                               // read
s.close();                                  // close the stream
s.nextLine();                               // IllegalStateException
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Java's \keyword{Scanner} misuse example.}
    \label{lst:java-scanner}
\end{listing}

If we consider a typestated language, as in \autoref{lst:java-scanner-typestate},
the code allows us to trace the state of the object, but even better,
the compiler is now able to tell us there is an error during compilation.

\begin{listing}
    \begin{minted}{java}
Scanner[Open] s = new Scanner(System.in);   // open the stream
s.nextLine();                               // read
Scanner[Closed] s = s.close();              // close the stream
s.nextLine();                               // compile-time error
    \end{minted}
    \caption{
        Typestated \keyword{Scanner} example.
        Notice how the compiler is able to detect the error.
    }
    \label{lst:java-scanner-typestate}
\end{listing}

\section{State of the Art}\label{sec:state-of-the-art}

As it stands, current mainstream languages do not provide first-class support for behavioral types,
leaving developers to write their own abstractions over the language typesystem.
These abstractions will usually be built on top of existing meta-programming capabilities offered by the language,
or with the help of external tools in an ad-hoc fashion.
The latter is the most common approach as it allows the built tool to take advantage of other existing tools.
This is Mungo's case \autocite{Kouzapas2018, Voinea2020},
a language which generates a Java API skeleton along with a typestate specification from a
Scribble \autocite{Yoshida2014} protocol.

In Rust's ecosystem a crate providing typestated futures exists, the \texttt{state\_machine\_future} crate \autocite{Fitzgerald2019},
it also provides some state machine related guarantees, such as that every state is reachable from the start start,
there are no states unable to reach the final state and all state transitions are invalid.
Furthermore, these guarantees are provided at compile-time, invalid state transitions, for example, fail to compile.
The crate, however, revolves around futures, requiring a runtime and thus making it unsuitable for other kinds of applications.
Other crates exist, they focus on finite state machines but are unable to provide static guarantees.

Amidst the previous topics, Scribble and Rust's crates, there exists a third alternative, rooted in session types.
The work done by \autocite{Jespersen2015, Munksgaard2015} introduces bi-directional session types to Rust,
since then, this line of work has been expanded by \autocite{Lagaillardie2020},
extending it to multiparty session types.

Finally, regarding typestates, languages like Plaid \autocite{Aldrich2009} and Obsidian \autocite{Coblenz2020, Coblenz2020a}
put typestates to use. Plaid in an object-oriented context
while Obsidian makes use of typestates and linear types to provide more safety when writing blockchain smart contracts.

\section{Objectives \& Contributions}\label{sec:objectives}

In this thesis I try to bridge the gap between typestates and Rust,
aiming for an elegant and usable solution, allowing for effective usage of typestates in Rust.
To achieve such solution I expect to develop an embedded Rust DSL,
enabling the flexibility of a dedicated language without leaving the Rust ecosystem.

To this effect I expect the contributions of this thesis to be a typestate specification DSL to be embedded in Rust,
shipped as a crate (i.e. library), as well as a small survey over the usability of the DSL.
